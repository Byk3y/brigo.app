The landscape of education is shifting. In 2026, students are no longer just memorizing facts; they are leveraging artificial intelligence to personalize their learning experience.

## The Rise of Adaptive Learning

Adaptive learning platforms like **Brigo** are leading the charge. By analyzing how you interact with materials, these systems can predict exactly where you'll struggle before you even take an exam.

### Why Structured Data Matters

In a world where the average person receives **237 notifications per day** and spends over **five hours staring at screens**, it's perhaps unsurprising that "brain rot" has been crowned Oxford's Word of the Year for 2024. But what exactly is brain rot, and why has this term resonated so deeply with millions worldwide?

> "The supposed deterioration of a person's mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging."

## What is Brigo Doing Differently?

We believe that learning shouldn't be a passive activity. By turning your notes into interactive podcasts and predicting your accuracy with 98% precision, we help you break free from the "brain rot" loop and into a deep work state.

*   **Smart Predictions**: Know your score before you sit for the test.
*   **Audio Learning**: Study while you move.
*   **Focus-First Design**: No distractions, just growth.
