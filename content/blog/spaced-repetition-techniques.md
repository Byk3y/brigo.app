Have you ever studied for hours, only to forget everything the next day? You're not alone. The **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve** shows that we lose 70% of new information within 24 hours if we don't review it.

## The Secret: Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals. Instead of cramming for 5 hours in one night, you study for 10 minutes over 5 days.

### 1. The Leitner System

This is the classic flashcard box method. If you get a card right, it moves to a "later" box. If you get it wrong, it goes back to the "daily" box.

### 2. Active Recall

Don't just read your notes. Force your brain to retrieve the information. Brigo's **AI Quizzer** does this automatically by generating questions from your PDFs.

## How Brigo Automates the Science

We've built an algorithm that calculates the optimal time for you to review a concept. When you use Brigo, you don't have to think about *when* to study—you just open the app and follow the path.
