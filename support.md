## 🏆 Featured: Exam Prediction

**"How does Brigo know what will be on my exam?"**

Brigo's Exam Prediction is our most advanced feature. It doesn't just "guess"—it analyzes.

- **Frequency Analysis:** Brigo identifies recurring themes, vocabulary density, and core concepts within your notes and past papers.
- **Trend Detection:** If you upload papers from multiple years, Brigo identifies "Rising" topics (appearing more recently) and "Stable" foundational topics.
- **Model Marking Schemes:** For essay-style predictions, we provide answers structured as marking schemes so you know exactly how to earn the most points.
- **Pro Tip:** For the most accurate predictions, upload your **Course Syllabus** alongside your **Lecture Notes**. This gives the AI the "blueprint" and the "content" to compare.

## 🐾 The Study Pet & Streaks

Your study journey is powered by your companion.

- **Growth Stages:** Your pet grows through 3 stages based on your "Focus Points." Earn points by completing quizzes and reviewing flashcards.
- **Missions & Tasks:** Check your Pet Sheet for "Foundational" and "Daily" tasks. These are designed to keep your study habit consistent.
- **The "Dying" State:** If you miss a study day without a **Streak Freeze**, your pet will enter a weakened state.
- **Salvaging a Streak:** If you lose your streak, you can use a Streak Freeze within 24 hours to restore it and "revive" your pet.
- **Streak Freezes:** You earn these through consistent study or milestones. They are your safety net for busy days!

## 🧬 The Brigo Methodology: The Science of Learning

Brigo isn't just an app; it's a scientific study tool built on two pillars of educational psychology:

- **Active Recall:** Instead of passively re-reading your notes (which is often ineffective), Brigo’s quizzes and flashcards force your brain to retrieve information. Research shows that **Active Recall is up to 3x more effective** than traditional reviewing.
- **Spaced Repetition:** Our Study Pet and streak mechanics are designed to bring you back to your materials at the optimal intervals. By reviewing content just as you are about to forget it, you move information from short-term memory to long-term mastery.

## 🎙️ AI Studio Tools

Transform your materials into active study aids.

- **Audio Overviews:** Brigo creates high-quality, podcast-style summaries of your notebooks. Perfect for listening during commutes or at the gym. 
- **Smart Quizzes:** We generate multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions tailored to your education level.
- **Flashcard Decks:** Automatically extracted key terms and concepts for quick active recall sessions.
- **Daily Limits:** To ensure a high-quality experience for everyone, we have daily limits on how many high-level resources (Audio, Quizzes, Predictions) can be generated.
- **Unlimited with Brigo Pro:** Upgrading to Pro removes these limits, giving you infinite generations for all your study materials.
- **Status Check:** You can see your current plan and management options in the **Subscription** section of your settings.

### 🧪 Troubleshooting "Bad" AI Outputs
Because Brigo uses Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a small chance the AI may "hallucinate" or provide a prediction that feels slightly off.

**How to get better results:**
- **Provide More Context:** If a prediction is vague, try uploading more specific materials (e.g., your actual past exam papers instead of just general notes).
- **Clear & Legible Uploads:** If your handwritten notes are blurry, the AI might misinterpret key terms. Ensure high-contrast, well-lit photos.
- **Re-Generate:** You can re-run a generation with different materials in the Studio to refine the AI's focus.

## 📂 Importing & Materials

- **YouTube Extraction:** Paste a YouTube link, and Brigo will extract the transcript, summarize it, and add it to your notebook.
- **Web Discovery:** Use our "Discover" feature to find high-quality academic sources across the web and import them instantly.
- **Handwritten Notes:** Our OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is designed to read handwriting. For best results, ensure your photos are well-lit and the text is not obscured.

## 💳 Billing & Subscriptions (Self-Service)

Most billing inquiries can be resolved directly through your device settings. Since Brigo uses the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for all transactions, we do not have direct access to your credit card information or the ability to cancel subscriptions on your behalf.

### How to Cancel or Manage your Subscription

#### **On iPhone/iPad (iOS):**
1. Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone.
2. Tap your **Name** at the very top.
3. Tap **Subscriptions**.
4. Find **Brigo** in the list and tap it.
5. Tap **Cancel Subscription**. (If you don't see "Cancel," the subscription is already canceled and won't renew).

#### **On Android:**
1. Open the **Google Play Store** app.
2. Tap your **Profile Icon** at the top right.
3. Tap **Payments & Subscriptions** > **Subscriptions**.
4. Select **Brigo** from the list.
5. Tap **Cancel Subscription** and follow the instructions.

### Refunds
Refunds are handled entirely by Apple and Google. We are unable to issue refunds directly.
- **Apple Users:** Visit [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com) to request a refund.
- **Android Users:** You can request a refund through the [Google Play website](https://support.google.com/googleplay/workflow/9813544).

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is Brigo's prediction a guarantee of my exam results?**  
**A:** No. Brigo is a powerful study aid designed to highlight high-probability topics based on your specific materials. It should be used to *prioritize* your revision, not as a replacement for studying the full curriculum.

**Q: My AI generation is taking a long time. Why?**  
**A:** "Deep Extraction" and "Exam Prediction" are computationally heavy. Most tasks finish in under 60 seconds, but complex PDFs or long YouTube videos may take up to 2 minutes.

**Q: Can I share my notebooks with friends?**  
**A:** Currently, notebooks are private to your account to ensure data security and personalized AI analysis.
